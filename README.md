# Social-Network-API
## A backend only API for a social network web application

- What was your motivation? Building a backend api and testing out my skills based on what I remember and know 
- Problems I faced. Well I received some help that really set me back and I had to redo my routes. I also encountered an issue where it kept throwing a duplicate key error. This was tricky, but after researching on google, I found I had to open Mongo Shell and update the first key index and once I did that I was able to add as many users as I wanted. I know my code worked but couldn't demonstrate all of it in it's entirety because I could not see the paths. Th visual provided were moving too fast for me and I was really tired over coming a really bad cold, but I perservered. 

## Resources

Google, office hours, stack overflow, research, and troubleshooting 

## Installation

-Open terminal
- run node index
- test out endpoints in insomniafor your get, put, delete routes for user, thought, and reactions from friends

##  Summary

All in all this was a fun project to execute. I figured out a way to not have to use my controllers but learned why it is a good idea to use them to segment the code and allow it to have better readability. The duplicate key value issue was new to me and I was proud I was able to research, and figure out a solution on my own. I am eagered to learn and know there are many ways I can improve. I did experience issues with recording the my app. I ran out of free videos and then recorded the perfect video that of course did not record the correct screen lol.
